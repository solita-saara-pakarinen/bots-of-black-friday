TypeScript bot template

Api calls to bot server are implemented in `src/api.ts`. These use fetch api on Node.js so Node.js 18+ is required. This is documented also in .nvmrc so if you use nvm, you can set the used version with it.

By default running with `npm start` connects to the game server in the cloud. If you want to run against a local instance, set environment variable `NODE_ENV=development`.

Go ahead and implement your bot in index.ts! Enjoy!

npm install typescript -g
npm i --save-dev @types/node
npm config get prefix
